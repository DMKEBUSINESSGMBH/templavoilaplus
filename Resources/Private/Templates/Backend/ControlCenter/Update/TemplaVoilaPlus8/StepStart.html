    <h2 class="text-primary">Update configuration to TemplaVoil√†! Plus 8</h2>

    <p class="lead">TV+ 8 significantly changed the configuration. All configurations are now done in files instead instead of the database. Until now, configuration coming from files was only possible with the experimental Static DataStructures. This changes make it possible to have deployment strategies and creating theme extensions and you get the ability to manage your design better inside version control systems (VCS), so handling design updates on your website should work better. As another added bonus, we now only have one map field in the pages/tt_content tables editor, so you can't break the ds/to fields anymore.</p>
    <p class="lead">To get all this to happen, TV+ 8 introduce a concept of "configuration places". Every place contains one aspect of configuration, we removed the mixing of different aspects so parts of the configuration can be reused more easily. Breaking the hard binding between DataStructure and Template allows us also to use different Template Engines, until now the good old XPath was used but now others can be provided by extensions or you can write your own one. Also different loaders allows you to use modern configuration languages together at same time, like the good old XML and the newer Yaml, to migrate slowly to your type of modern setup.</p>
    <p class="lead">Every place configures a LoadSaveHandler for the file format, a ConfigurationHandler for the configuration type and an entry point to find the configuration files. We use three different configuration types. The first one is DataConfiguration, which only contain the good old data structuring (a.k.a. FlexForm), plain core without processing instructions or anything else. The second one is the TemplateConfiguration, which defines what template file to use, what RenderHandler should be called and mostly configures the RenderHandler with information about how to render (for example the XPath RenderHandler needs to know which variable has which XPath) and anything else that is needed for a good rendering. The new third configuration type is the MappingConfiguration (may change the name to ProcessingConfiguration) that defines what to do with the values of the DataStructure fields, of row fields or of TypoScript paths as well as differentiating which names of the template they should be transferred. This mapping information is also the part which your editor will select later on the page or content level.</p>
    <p class="lead">This update script helps you to move your configuration out of your database (or the static DataStructures) and your templates from fileadmin into an extension. The benefit of this is that you can check these files into your VCS to manage changes with history and backup or deploy them as usuel TYPO3 extension.</p>
    <p class="lead">That's probably enough details for the moment, go ahead and start your update right now, TV+ will guide you through the process with multiple steps to a hopefully functional system. At first, we need to check what your current system includes and how this update script can help you.</p>

    <f:comment> What TODO with the storage_pid check? We may need a check if there is more than one storage_pid to get different theme extensions.
